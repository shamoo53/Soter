# On-Chain Module (Soroban Contracts)

This module contains Soroban smart contracts for Soter's on-chain escrow and claimable packages functionality.

## 🧠 AidEscrow Contract

The **AidEscrow** contract facilitates secure, transparent aid disbursement. Packages are created for specific recipients with locked funds, and can be disbursed by administrators.

### Core Invariants
* **Pool Model:** Funds must be deposited into the contract via `fund()` before they can be allocated to packages.
* **Solvency:** A package cannot be created if `Contract Balance < Total Locked Amount + New Package Amount`.
* **State Machine:** A package transitions through various statuses: `Created` -> `Claimed` (or `Expired`, `Cancelled` -> `Refunded`).
* **Time-Bounds:** Packages can have expiration times. Claiming is blocked after expiration.
* **Admin Sovereignty:** Only the admin or authorized distributors can create packages. Only the admin can pause, configure, or manually disburse funds.

### Event schema (indexer-friendly)

Events use **stable topic identifiers** (struct name in snake_case) so indexers and dashboards can filter reliably. Payloads are compact; no PII. Do not rename event types without a versioning strategy.

| Event type (topic) | When emitted | Fields |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `escrow_funded` | Pool is funded | `from`, `token`, `amount`, `timestamp` |
| `package_created` | Package created | `package_id`, `recipient`, `amount`, `actor`, `timestamp` |
| `package_claimed` | Recipient claims package | `package_id`, `recipient`, `amount`, `actor`, `timestamp` |
| `package_disbursed` | Admin disburses to recipient | `package_id`, `recipient`, `amount`, `actor`, `timestamp` |
| `package_revoked` | Package cancelled/revoked | `package_id`, `recipient`, `amount`, `actor`, `timestamp` |
| `package_refunded` | Funds refunded to admin | `package_id`, `recipient`, `amount`, `actor`, `timestamp` |
| `batch_created_event` | Batch of packages created | `ids`, `admin`, `total_amount` |
| `extended_event` | Package expiry extended | `id`, `admin`, `old_expires_at`, `new_expires_at` |
| `surplus_withdrawn_event` | Surplus funds withdrawn | `to`, `token`, `amount` |

**Sample (package_created):**
```json
{
  "topics": ["package_created"],
  "data": {
    "package_id": 1,
    "recipient": "<address>",
    "amount": "1000000000",
    "actor": "<address>",
    "timestamp": 1234567890
  }
}
```
